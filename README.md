# Queuing-Systems
Different Queuing Systems using JAVA
This is a training project about implementing queuing systems simulation using java language
There are two main forms of queuing method including Markov' Chain Simulation and Discrete Event Simulation (DES)

# Markov' Chain
  - State changing oriented
  
# Discrete Event Simulation
  - Every incoming arrival is regarded as one discrete event
  - object based
